# Games Workshop FAQ Mirror(er)

This scripts checks the Games Workshop Warhammer Community FAQ page for new or non-existent FAQs and attempts to download any newer versions or new files.

## Getting Started

You'll need Python installed on your system. Instructions to do so can be found here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Prerequisites

You'll need a fairly current version of python3 or python2, but the requirements are pretty minimal. Both versions work with this script.


### Installing

The default config will download the files into a directory the script is located. If you're wanting to change the "base path", just copy the config.sample.py to config.py and change the settings there. The config.py will not be overwritten with subsequent git pulls, and the config.sample.py will have a list of all the options you can change in subsequent versions.
